Project Rules -------------
• Implement all the necessary functions/elements for the representation of the OP,
respecting its constraints.
• Implement at least three different mutation operators
• Implement at least three different crossover operators
• Propose a final model (with the specific operators and parameters used) that is the
result of a grid search of at least 15 runs.


Project Evaluation --------
• Project Report - 20%. In the report you must describe the methodology used,
provide the literature review of Genetic Operators that you used and present the
results (with plots) of your final proposed model

• Implementations - 45%. This part of the evaluation corresponds to the quality
and efficiency of your implementations. Note that quality refers to both the quality
of your code and the complexity/originality of the genetic operators used.

• Project Methodology and Requirements - 10%. This part of the evaluation
corresponds to the quality of your methodology with regards to the grid search
strategies you chose and your overall project organization, as well as your compliance with the rules

• Implementations (competition value) - 15%. This part of the evaluation corresponds to the comparison of your implementations with the ones provided by the
other groups. You will be given a score based on:
– The number of operators you implemented in comparison to other groups
– The complexity of the operators you implemented in comparison to other
groups
– The originality of the operators you implemented in comparison to other
groups

• Model performance (competition value) - 10%. This part of the evaluation
corresponds to the performance of your final proposed model on the unseen data,
in comparison to the performance of the models proposed by the other groups.
