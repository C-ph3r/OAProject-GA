Objective: Maximise Geo earnings
Create a pipeline that allows the algorithm to learn 
in the most robust way possible, considering different Geo earning /
loss that will occur between each areas.


Possible areas:
Dirtmouth (D) - Start and end
Forgotten Crossroads (FC)
Greenpath (G)
Queen's Station (QS)
Queen's Gardens (QG)
City Storerooms (CS)
King’s Station (KS)
Resting Grounds (RG)
Distant Village (DV)
Stag Nest (SN)


Rules:
• All sessions must begin and end in Dirtmouth (D).
• Your friend is ok with not visiting King’s Station (KS) as long as they visit the
Distant Village (DV) immediately after Queen’s Station (QS). They say that they
are ok with this skip because the QS-DV sequence is very hard and tiring, so the
addition of KS is unnecessary.
• For similar reasons, City Storerooms (CS) cannot be visited right after Queen’s
Garden’s (QG).
• When considering different Geo earning values, know that more often than not
moving from one area to the next results in a Geo gain and not loss.
• When trying different Geo earning values, keep in mind that the Geo gained by
passing from Greenpath (G) to Forgotten Crossroads (FC) must be at least 3.2 %
less than the minimum between all the other positive Geo gains.
• The Resting Grounds (RG) can only be reached in the last half of the session.
• Very important: You are to organize this data in the form of list of lists (i.e., a
matrix) where each list represents an area and contains the Geo gained by moving
from that area to all the other areas.
Note that the goal is to obtain one and only one route! Your friend will always
take the same route, the one proposed by you!
